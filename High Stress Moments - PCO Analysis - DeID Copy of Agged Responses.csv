AGENT (2025-05-08 15:02:00+00): Hey there, Carin. Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:
1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

AGENT (2025-05-19 14:05:00+00): Hey, Carin. Good to hear from you! Ever wonder how to build better goals? One tip is to set “approach” goals. This means defining what you’ll do — rather than what you’ll avoid. For example, instead of saying “I won’t eat candy” an approach goal could be “I’ll try fruit when I crave sugar.” Approach goals are linked with more positive feelings, and can be easier to stick with. So, what WILL you work on soon? Let us know!

We’ve sent over your 100 points. Hope you have a great week!

 So let’s start there today.
CONSUMER (2025-05-19 17:18:00+00): Goal: learn more about living with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. 
CONSUMER (2025-05-19 17:18:00+00): I can start by researching the internet and talking with my doctor. 
AGENT (2025-05-19 17:44:00+00): Thank you for sharing that with us Carin and we certainly want to support in learning more about that condition. If you like we can work with our internal team to see what information we can share around that for you.

AGENT (2025-05-19 21:08:00+00): Hello Carin and happy Monday! We are reaching back out regarding your inquiry about information on cardiogenic pulmonary edema. We greatly appreciate your time and patience while we conducted our search. At this time, we would like to share a couple of resources from our sources, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Healthline.
AGENT (2025-05-19 21:08:00+00): According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), pulmonary edema can be broadly classified into cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic involves the heart and noncardiogenic involves the lungs. Pulmonary edema can be a result of multiorgan involvement, and hence the involvement of an interprofessional team such as internists (primary care provider), cardiology (cardiologist), pulmonology (pulmonologist) early in the course is recommended for timely initiation of targeted therapy to improve patient outcomes.
AGENT (2025-05-19 21:08:00+00): Pulmonary Edema

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557611/
AGENT (2025-05-19 21:08:00+00): According to Healthline, The best way to try and prevent pulmonary edema is by taking good care of your health: get a pneumonia vaccine and the flu vaccine (especially if you have heart problems or are an older adult), remain on diuretics after an episode of pulmonary edema to prevent a re-occurrence.
AGENT (2025-05-19 21:08:00+00): You can also decrease your risk for heart failure, the most common cause of pulmonary edema with the following steps: visit a doctor regularly, avoid smoking or quit smoking if you smoke, avoid illegal drugs, get regular exercise, eat nutritious foods, and maintain your weight.


AGENT (2025-05-19 21:09:00+00): What Is Pulmonary Edema?
https://www.healthline.com/health/pulmonary-edema

AGENT (2025-05-19 21:09:00+00): Carin, please keep in mind that, while our information is gathered from evidence-based sources, we do not practice medicine and this information should not be used in place of your provider’s guidance. We encourage you to continue to stay connected with your provider to discuss this topic in more detail and to follow their guidelines.

CONSUMER (2025-05-21 14:15:00+00): Yes I’d like to start a new goal. Something about forgiveness. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 14:19:00+00): We would be happy to support Carin. Let’s start with that big picture vision… When you think about the future, what do you want in terms of forgiveness? 
CONSUMER (2025-05-21 14:33:00+00): Forgiving doctors who made medical mistakes that negatively affected my life. It’s happened often unfortunately. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 14:58:00+00): THanks for sharing,Carin. How will you benefit if you start to forgive more?
CONSUMER (2025-05-21 15:29:00+00): I’m hoping to decrease anxiety at doctor’s appointments. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): Thank you foe letting us know. At Well, we use a “SMART” framework to set goals. You should use each letter as a guide to create a single goal. Think about what you’d like to change and how it could fit in this framework.

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): S = Specific. Focus on 1 clear change at a time.

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): M = Measurable. Consider how often or how long you want to work on it.

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): A = Action-oriented. Define something within your control. And focus on what you CAN do – not what you'll avoid.

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): R = Realistic. Goals should feel challenging, but doable. Consider what resources and support will make this goal reachable for you. 

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): T = Time-bound. Goals should include a timeline of when you’ll start, finish, or check on progress.

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:26:00+00): You said that you want to decrease anxiety at your doctor's appoints. What action will you do to achieve this goal?

CONSUMER (2025-05-21 16:28:00+00): Decrease thoughts about past mistakes 
AGENT (2025-05-21 16:54:00+00): Thank you so much, Carin. Looks like for your goal you are looking to decrease thoughts about past mistakes. Can you tell us a bit more around how you are looking to do that? Is there a specific activity or exercise you are looking to do when a thought surfaces?
CONSUMER (2025-05-21 16:56:00+00): Journaling has helped me. I can write about how I’m feeling and use affirmations to help decrease negative thoughts. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 17:25:00+00): We sincerely appreciate you sharing a bit more about this specific goal, Carin. Really amazing work so far! Are you looking to do this every time a thought surface, or dedicate some time on your day for journaling (if so, how long?)
CONSUMER (2025-05-21 17:29:00+00): Dedicated time for journaling prior to each doctor’s appointment. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 18:08:00+00): Great! And how will you measure whether or not you completed your goal? Additionally, how many times this week will you be journaling?
CONSUMER (2025-05-21 18:13:00+00): I have an appointment tomorrow so I’ll start tomorrow. I’d like to extend this goal for 3 months as I have several upcoming doctors appointments. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 18:45:00+00): That is a great goal to focus on Carin. As you look to get started what do you need to begin your goal? Also does this goal feel like this is enough of a challenge, but not too much?


CONSUMER (2025-05-21 19:43:00+00): I have everything I need and I think this goal is absolutely attainable. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 19:56:00+00): Excellent! Just a couple more questions to go. As you think about making this change, what type of support might need to have in place? (Like someone who can lend a hand, or an external support like a reminder system.)

CONSUMER (2025-05-21 20:00:00+00): I set a reminder on my phone. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 20:04:00+00): Now that we’ve set your goal, let’s make a plan to follow-up. We can coach you for up to 4 weeks on a goal. How many more sessions do you want?

CONSUMER (2025-05-21 20:36:00+00): 4 weeks please. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 20:44:00+00): In summary, you’ve defined your vision as decrease anxiety at doctor’s appointments. And a step you are taking this week towards achieving it is to write about how I’m feeling and use affirmations to help decrease negative thoughts..

AGENT (2025-05-28 16:10:00+00): Hi, Carin. It’s time to check in on your SMART goal. How would you rate your progress this week? (Using a scale from 0%-100% where 0 = you didn’t work on it to 100% if you fully completed it.)
CONSUMER (2025-05-28 16:18:00+00): 95….I’m pretty determined once I set my mind to something. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 16:57:00+00): Awesome, Carin! Sounds like determination paid off!

AGENT (2025-05-28 16:57:00+00): What have you learned about yourself as you worked on this recently?
CONSUMER (2025-05-28 17:00:00+00): I’m a very strong willed individual. I suffer from PTSD due to doctors’ mistakes in the past that almost killed me. Little by little I’m working on regaining trust and lowering anxiety regarding doctors appointments. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 17:03:00+00): Thanks for sharing, Carin. Given your experience in the past week, let’s talk about what you may need to best support you going forward. What skills, social support, or resources would help you make progress?

CONSUMER (2025-05-28 17:04:00+00): I’m working with a therapist already and that’s helping immensely. I journal before appointments to calm myself. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 17:09:00+00): Perfect, Carin. Sounds like journaling & therapy worked for you.

CONSUMER (2025-05-28 17:10:00+00): Yes thank you. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 17:13:00+00): Perfect, Carin. For this coming week, would you like to stick with the same goal, or make any changes? 

CONSUMER (2025-05-28 17:13:00+00): Same goal please. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 17:20:00+00): Sounds good, Carin. You will continue working on the same goal.
Your goal will still be to dedicate time for journaling prior to each doctor’s appointment in order to avoid past mistakes
CONSUMER (2025-05-28 17:20:00+00): Sounds great. Thank you. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 17:22:00+00): Your welcome, Carin! 
How confident are you, from 0-10 that you can reach this goal? (Where 0 is not at all confident and 10 is extremely confident)

CONSUMER (2025-05-28 18:03:00+00): 9

AGENT (2025-05-19 21:08:00+00): According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), pulmonary edema can be broadly classified into cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic involves the heart and noncardiogenic involves the lungs. Pulmonary edema can be a result of multiorgan involvement, and hence the involvement of an interprofessional team such as internists (primary care provider), cardiology (cardiologist), pulmonology (pulmonologist) early in the course is recommended for timely initiation of targeted therapy to improve patient outcomes.

AGENT (2025-05-19 21:08:00+00): According to Healthline, The best way to try and prevent pulmonary edema is by taking good care of your health: get a pneumonia vaccine and the flu vaccine (especially if you have heart problems or are an older adult), remain on diuretics after an episode of pulmonary edema to prevent a re-occurrence.
AGENT (2025-05-19 21:08:00+00): You can also decrease your risk for heart failure, the most common cause of pulmonary edema with the following steps: visit a doctor regularly, avoid smoking or quit smoking if you smoke, avoid illegal drugs, get regular exercise, eat nutritious foods, and maintain your weight.

AGENT (2025-05-21 13:57:00+00): Hey MM! We are here to help with setting a SMART goal. Would you still be interested in this SMART Goal or another topic of your choice! If any of these things would interest you, please feel free to chat in!


CONSUMER (2025-05-21 14:15:00+00): Yes I’d like to start a new goal. Something about forgiveness. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 14:19:00+00): We would be happy to support MM. Let’s start with that big picture vision… When you think about the future, what do you want in terms of forgiveness? 
CONSUMER (2025-05-21 14:33:00+00): Forgiving doctors who made medical mistakes that negatively affected my life. It’s happened often unfortunately. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 14:58:00+00): THanks for sharing,MM. How will you benefit if you start to forgive more?
CONSUMER (2025-05-21 15:29:00+00): I’m hoping to decrease anxiety at doctor’s appointments. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): Thank you foe letting us know. At Well, we use a “SMART” framework to set goals. You should use each letter as a guide to create a single goal. Think about what you’d like to change and how it could fit in this framework.

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): S = Specific. Focus on 1 clear change at a time.

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): M = Measurable. Consider how often or how long you want to work on it.

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): A = Action-oriented. Define something within your control. And focus on what you CAN do – not what you'll avoid.

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): R = Realistic. Goals should feel challenging, but doable. Consider what resources and support will make this goal reachable for you. 

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:24:00+00): T = Time-bound. Goals should include a timeline of when you’ll start, finish, or check on progress.

AGENT (2025-05-21 16:26:00+00): You said that you want to decrease anxiety at your doctor's appoints. What action will you do to achieve this goal?

CONSUMER (2025-05-21 16:28:00+00): Decrease thoughts about past mistakes 
AGENT (2025-05-21 16:54:00+00): Thank you so much, MM. Looks like for your goal you are looking to decrease thoughts about past mistakes. Can you tell us a bit more around how you are looking to do that? Is there a specific activity or exercise you are looking to do when a thought surfaces?
CONSUMER (2025-05-21 16:56:00+00): Journaling has helped me. I can write about how I’m feeling and use affirmations to help decrease negative thoughts. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 17:25:00+00): We sincerely appreciate you sharing a bit more about this specific goal, MM. Really amazing work so far! Are you looking to do this every time a thought surface, or dedicate some time on your day for journaling (if so, how long?)
CONSUMER (2025-05-21 17:29:00+00): Dedicated time for journaling prior to each doctor’s appointment. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 18:08:00+00): Great! And how will you measure whether or not you completed your goal? Additionally, how many times this week will you be journaling?
CONSUMER (2025-05-21 18:13:00+00): I have an appointment tomorrow so I’ll start tomorrow. I’d like to extend this goal for 3 months as I have several upcoming doctors appointments. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 18:45:00+00): That is a great goal to focus on MM. As you look to get started what do you need to begin your goal? Also does this goal feel like this is enough of a challenge, but not too much?


CONSUMER (2025-05-21 19:43:00+00): I have everything I need and I think this goal is absolutely attainable. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 19:56:00+00): Excellent! Just a couple more questions to go. As you think about making this change, what type of support might need to have in place? (Like someone who can lend a hand, or an external support like a reminder system.)

CONSUMER (2025-05-21 20:00:00+00): I set a reminder on my phone. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 20:04:00+00): Now that we’ve set your goal, let’s make a plan to follow-up. We can coach you for up to 4 weeks on a goal. How many more sessions do you want?

CONSUMER (2025-05-21 20:36:00+00): 4 weeks please. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 20:44:00+00): In summary, you’ve defined your vision as decrease anxiety at doctor’s appointments. And a step you are taking this week towards achieving it is to write about how I’m feeling and use affirmations to help decrease negative thoughts..

AGENT (2025-05-28 16:10:00+00): Hi, MM. It’s time to check in on your SMART goal. How would you rate your progress this week? (Using a scale from 0%-100% where 0 = you didn’t work on it to 100% if you fully completed it.)
CONSUMER (2025-05-28 16:18:00+00): 95….I’m pretty determined once I set my mind to something. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 16:57:00+00): Awesome, MM! Sounds like determination paid off!

AGENT (2025-05-28 16:57:00+00): What have you learned about yourself as you worked on this recently?
CONSUMER (2025-05-28 17:00:00+00): I’m a very strong willed individual. I suffer from PTSD due to doctors’ mistakes in the past that almost killed me. Little by little I’m working on regaining trust and lowering anxiety regarding doctors appointments. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 17:03:00+00): Thanks for sharing, MM. Given your experience in the past week, let’s talk about what you may need to best support you going forward. What skills, social support, or resources would help you make progress?

CONSUMER (2025-05-28 17:04:00+00): I’m working with a therapist already and that’s helping immensely. I journal before appointments to calm myself. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 17:09:00+00): Perfect, MM. Sounds like journaling & therapy worked for you.

CONSUMER (2025-05-28 17:10:00+00): Yes thank you. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 17:13:00+00): Perfect, MM. For this coming week, would you like to stick with the same goal, or make any changes? 

CONSUMER (2025-05-28 17:13:00+00): Same goal please. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 17:20:00+00): Sounds good, MM. You will continue working on the same goal.
Your goal will still be to dedicate time for journaling prior to each doctor’s appointment in order to avoid past mistakes
CONSUMER (2025-05-28 17:20:00+00): Sounds great. Thank you. 
AGENT (2025-05-28 17:22:00+00): Your welcome, MM! 
How confident are you, from 0-10 that you can reach this goal? (Where 0 is not at all confident and 10 is extremely confident)

AGENT (2025-05-08 16:26:00+00): Hey there, Alec. Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:
1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

AGENT (2025-05-14 17:15:00+00): Hey, Erick. Good to hear from you! Ever wonder how to build better goals? One tip is to set “approach” goals. This means defining what you’ll do — rather than what you’ll avoid. For example, instead of saying “I won’t eat candy” an approach goal could be “I’ll try fruit when I crave sugar.” Approach goals are linked with more positive feelings, and can be easier to stick with.

CONSUMER (2025-05-19 15:32:00+00): Organize my meds
AGENT (2025-05-19 16:00:00+00): Hi, Erick. We’re here with tips for organizing meds. Here are four different ways to keep track of your pills.

Get a pill box. These are special boxes with compartments for each of your meds. They come in all shapes and sizes. You can choose one with as many compartments as you need. And you can fill up your pill box on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. You can get these at the pharmacy or online.
Try an automatic pill dispenser. These are electronic devices that you (or a trusted friend or doctor) can program to automatically dispense your dose when you need it. They often have light or other signal to notify you when to take your meds, so you don’t miss a dose.
Use a color-coded system. This is helpful if you have meds for different times of day. Get a pack of colored labels to stick on your prescriptions. For example, assign green to your morning meds, blue to lunch-time meds and purple to nighttime meds. Then, you won't mix up when to take each pill.
Create a med checklist. Make a chart that lists each med, the dose, and what time you’ll take it. Then, check it off immediately after you take it. That way, you can refer back to the list if you’re not sure which meds you’ve taken yet. 

We hope this helps you stay on top of your meds. And we’ve sent 30 points!

AGENT (2025-06-04 16:41:00+00): Good Afternoon, Erick. Do you have a space in mind that you’re ready to organize? If not, pick one out, since today is all about decluttering. Here are 3 tips to get going:

AGENT (2025-06-04 16:41:00+00): Step 1: Make 3 sorting piles (or bins). Label these as “Need it,” “Maybe,” or “Don’t need.” Take your time going through items. Challenge yourself to consider what things you could donate, recycle, or give away. 

AGENT (2025-06-04 16:41:00+00): Step 2: After sorting all piles, aim to move half (or more) of the “Maybe” pile into the “Don’t need” pile. Then, make a plan of where (and when) you can give or get rid of these items.

AGENT (2025-06-04 16:41:00+00): Step 3: Clean up time! Reorganize with labels, boxes, etc. Enlist the support of someone you trust to make the job easier. 

AGENT (2025-06-04 16:41:00+00): We have sent over your 30 points and hope you have a wonderful rest of your day!","CONSUMER (2025-05-08 17:12:00+00): Stuck
AGENT (2025-05-08 17:27:00+00): Hey there, MM. Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:
AGENT (2025-05-08 17:27:00+00): 1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too.
AGENT (2025-05-08 17:27:00+00): 
 So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

AGENT (2025-05-14 17:15:00+00): Hey, MM. Good to hear from you! Ever wonder how to build better goals? One tip is to set “approach” goals. This means defining what you’ll do — rather than what you’ll avoid. For example, instead of saying “I won’t eat candy” an approach goal could be “I’ll try fruit when I crave sugar.” Approach goals are linked with more positive feelings, and can be easier to stick with. So, what WILL you work on soon? Let us know!

Skip the plastic containers and water bottles. Instead, try reusable containers made of aluminum or glass. 
Swap out any personal care products that contain microbeads. Instead choose face washes and toothpastes that are labeled “plastic-free.” 
Avoid putting plastic under high heat. That means hand-washing plastics instead of using the dishwasher, and not microwaving plastics. 
Use wood or bamboo cutting boards instead of plastic. That way, you’ll avoid plastic pieces breaking off into the food you’re cutting,
Drink filtered water. You can install a filter on your sink to keep microplastics out of your tap water. 
Clean your air. A HEPA air filter will trap plastic particles and keep the air in your home plastic-free.

AGENT (2025-05-14 16:33:00+00): If you’ve ever heard someone say to “just chill,” you probably know it’s not always that simple. Sometimes we try to relax, but our minds run amuck with plans or worries. Here are 3 tips to consider:


AGENT (2025-05-14 16:33:00+00): 
1. Put on some slow-tempo music for 20 minutes. Follow along with the rhythm and melody. In studies, this helps the mind and body wind down.

AGENT (2025-05-14 16:33:00+00): 2. Take 5 minutes to jot down what’s on your mind — before you go to relax. This can clear the mind.

AGENT (2025-05-14 16:33:00+00): 3. Dedicate a certain space, day, and time to relax. During this time, you could meditate, breathe calmly, or imagine yourself in a relaxing spot (like in nature). Doing this as a habit trains your body to relax when you’re there.

AGENT (2025-05-22 15:53:00+00): Good Morning, Paru. We’re here with tips for organizing meds. Here are four different ways to keep track of your pills.
AGENT (2025-05-22 15:53:00+00): Get a pill box. These are special boxes with compartments for each of your meds. They come in all shapes and sizes. You can choose one with as many compartments as you need. And you can fill up your pill box on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. You can get these at the pharmacy or online.

Use a color-coded system. This is helpful if you have meds for different times of day. Get a pack of colored labels to stick on your prescriptions. For example, assign green to your morning meds, blue to lunch-time meds and purple to nighttime meds. Then, you won't mix up when to take each pill.
Create a med checklist. Make a chart that lists each med, the dose, and what time you’ll take it. Then, check it off immediately after you take it. That way, you can refer back to the list if you’re not sure which meds you’ve taken yet.

AGENT (2025-05-29 17:22:00+00): Good Afternoon, Paru. Many people find it hard to start or stick with a goal when they doubt themselves, or their ability. If this comes up for you, a simple way to bolster confidence is through affirmations. These are simple statements that recognize your personal strengths or effort. Like telling yourself, “I’m strong” or “My sense of humor will get me through.” 

If you’re not sure what your strengths are, think about a past hardship that you overcame. What helped you? (Look for strengths like dedication, hard work, creativity, or teamwork).

CONSUMER (2025-05-22 15:30:00+00): Organize my meds
AGENT (2025-05-22 15:53:00+00): Good Morning, MM. We’re here with tips for organizing meds. Here are four different ways to keep track of your pills.
AGENT (2025-05-22 15:53:00+00): Get a pill box. These are special boxes with compartments for each of your meds. They come in all shapes and sizes. You can choose one with as many compartments as you need. And you can fill up your pill box on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. You can get these at the pharmacy or online.
Try an automatic pill dispenser. These are electronic devices that you (or a trusted friend or doctor) can program to automatically dispense your dose when you need it. They often have light or other signal to notify you when to take your meds, so you don’t miss a dose.
Use a color-coded system. This is helpful if you have meds for different times of day. Get a pack of colored labels to stick on your prescriptions. For example, assign green to your morning meds, blue to lunch-time meds and purple to nighttime meds. Then, you won't mix up when to take each pill.
Create a med checklist. Make a chart that lists each med, the dose, and what time you’ll take it. Then, check it off immediately after you take it. That way, you can refer back to the list if you’re not sure which meds you’ve taken yet. 
AGENT (2025-05-22 15:53:00+00): We hope this helps you stay on top of your meds. And we’ve sent 30 points!
AGENT (2025-05-23 16:51:00+00): Hello MM, we are checking in to see if you still need any support with redeeming your gift box. Please let us know if you found the previously sent information helpful, or if we can provide further support at this time!

AGENT (2025-05-29 17:22:00+00): Good Afternoon, MM. Many people find it hard to start or stick with a goal when they doubt themselves, or their ability. If this comes up for you, a simple way to bolster confidence is through affirmations. These are simple statements that recognize your personal strengths or effort. Like telling yourself, “I’m strong” or “My sense of humor will get me through.” 

If you’re not sure what your strengths are, think about a past hardship that you overcame. What helped you? (Look for strengths like dedication, hard work, creativity, or teamwork).

We’ve sent over your 100 points. Have a great day!

AGENT (2025-05-08 20:50:00+00): Hey there, Jeannie. Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:
1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

AGENT (2025-05-08 20:57:00+00): Hey, Wendy! Thanks for chatting. You’re not alone if you get heartburn from GLP-1 meds. Here are some simple tips that might help:

Try smaller portion sizes.
Avoid eating too close to bedtime.
Sleep on your left side, with the head of your bed elevated.
If you notice any foods make your heartburn worse, try avoiding them. Things like spicy food, citrus fruits, coffee, and chocolate are common culprits.
Remember that most side effects from GLP-1 meds get better with time.
Talk to your provider for more ideas, or to see if meds might help.

We hope these tips are helpful! Enjoy the rest of your day and the 30 points!

AGENT (2025-05-12 10:42:00+00): Hi Wendy! 
You can earn 50 points for setting a new goal with us today, and 100 points for weekly follow-ups.
We’ve adjusted this process recently, so that specific goals tie to a big picture “vision” of what you’d like to accomplish when it comes to health and wellness. So let’s start there today.

In a sentence (or two) can you please share what you’d like to achieve in the long-run with your health or wellness? We call this a “wellness vision.
CONSUMER (2025-05-12 11:10:00+00): The vision I have toward my future good health begins with every healthful food choice I make today. What has helped me the most so far is beginning my day with reflection and mindfulness meditation with my walk with the Lord and then a kale, blueberry and protein smoothie.
I have found that this begins my day with a solid foundation and energy to step into the new day with courage and determination. 
Secondly, I give myself room for imperfection and chalk up my mistakes as a learning experience and move on.
My new manta is “Eat the rainbow 🌈!”
For me, it begins with what I put in my mouth. This helps me to feel healthier and more energized to get out for my daily walk routine. 
Thank you for all of your help!!☺️
AGENT (2025-05-12 11:49:00+00): We sincerely appreciate you sharing, Wendy! Your vision is to always strive to make healthier food choices for ultimate wellbeing.
Now, let’s shift to creating the SMART goal for this week. It should represent a shorter-term step toward your vision. What do you have in mind that feels doable this week?

CONSUMER (2025-05-12 15:49:00+00): My SMART choice/vision for this week is to think (longer) before I speak.
My goal to to clearly express my thoughts in as few, concise words as possible.
AGENT (2025-05-12 16:03:00+00): You’ve defined your longer-term vision as to clearly express your thoughts in as few, concise words as possible. And now, what is a specific step you’re ready to take in that direction this week? What will your SMART goal be?

I have more than one goal in mind but my walks are more easily measured.
AGENT (2025-05-12 20:19:00+00): Wonderful! Before you start any new (or harder) exercises, remember to check in with your doctor. This is really important if you have any health conditions, injuries, or other concerns. Before we get started today, have you been cleared by a healthcare professional to start or change your exercise routine?

AGENT (2025-05-13 20:49:00+00): Wendy, one of the aspects of the SMART process is making sure your goal is measurable and centralized into a specific behavior. Walking is an excellent observable and measurable goal at this time! Apologies as we have a couple more questions before we wrap up. If you are interested, for up to four weeks, how long are you looking to work on this goal for?

Check the bristles on your toothbrush. When they’re bent or frayed, it’s time for a replacement.
Mark your calendar, or set a reminder on your phone to notify you 3 months after you start a new toothbrush. 
Consider changing your toothbrush at the beginning of each season. This will keep you on a 3 to 4 month timeline.
Keep a pack of spare toothbrushes (or electric brush-heads) in your bathroom. Having extras will make it easier to replace your brush at the 3 to 4 month mark.

We will just need an authorization from you to talk with your pharmacy. We will leave the authorization form for you here to look at and you can respond when you have a chance. If you agree to these terms, simply chat back “I agree.” Once we have your authorization, we’ll get started! Remember, you can chat with us later at any time to revoke this authorization.

I agree that CVS may give Well information or talk to Well until I no longer have the App, or for 6 months from today, whichever happens first. I understand that I can stop the CVS from giving information to Well, any time, by telling Well in writing. I understand that Well can rely on my permission to talk to or get information from CVS until I revoke my permission or it expires. I understand that the law requires Well to tell me that my information Well receives from CVS could be shared and could no longer be protected by law. But, since Well must follow the federal and other applicable privacy laws, it will protect my information as required by those laws. Well will not require that I allow my information to be shared in order for me to use the App and my CVS will not require that I share information with Well in order to provide me with pharmacy services. I have read this statement and I agree with its terms.

AGENT (2025-05-15 18:20:00+00): Thank you for providing that! To summarize: We will call CVS and request they change your eligible medications to a 3 month supply. If a new prescription is needed, we will ask the pharmacy to request a new 90-day supply prescription from your doctor. We will reach back out to you once we have spoken with your pharmacy.

For example, instead of saying “I won’t eat candy” an approach goal could be “I’ll try fruit when I crave sugar.” Approach goals are linked with more positive feelings, and can be easier to stick with.

Try smaller portion sizes.

AGENT (2025-05-12 17:19:00+00): Hello, Debora! Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:
1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

AGENT (2025-05-23 19:08:00+00): Hey, Debora. Good to hear from you! Ever wonder how to build better goals? One tip is to set “approach” goals. This means defining what you’ll do — rather than what you’ll avoid. For example, instead of saying “I won’t eat candy” an approach goal could be “I’ll try fruit when I crave sugar.” Approach goals are linked with more positive feelings, and can be easier to stick with. So, what WILL you work on soon? Let us know!

AGENT (2025-06-04 17:09:00+00): Hello, Debora! Thanks for chatting with us about microplastics. Here are 6 quick tips to limit your exposure to these tiny plastic particles. 

Skip the plastic containers and water bottles. Instead, try reusable containers made of aluminum or glass. 
Swap out any personal care products that contain microbeads. Instead choose face washes and toothpastes that are labeled “plastic-free.” 
Avoid putting plastic under high heat. That means hand-washing plastics instead of using the dishwasher, and not microwaving plastics. 
Use wood or bamboo cutting boards instead of plastic. That way, you’ll avoid plastic pieces breaking off into the food you’re cutting,
Drink filtered water. You can install a filter on your sink to keep microplastics out of your tap water. 
Clean your air. A HEPA air filter will trap plastic particles and keep the air in your home plastic-free.

AGENT (2025-05-28 19:23:00+00): Check the bristles on your toothbrush. When they’re bent or frayed, it’s time for a replacement.
Mark your calendar, or set a reminder on your phone to notify you 3 months after you start a new toothbrush. 
Consider changing your toothbrush at the beginning of each season. This will keep you on a 3 to 4 month timeline.
Keep a pack of spare toothbrushes (or electric brush-heads) in your bathroom. Having extras will make it easier to replace your brush at the 3 to 4 month mark.

Like telling yourself, “I’m strong” or “My sense of humor will get me through.” 

If you’re not sure what your strengths are, think about a past hardship that you overcame. What helped you? (Look for strengths like dedication, hard work, creativity, or teamwork).

AGENT (2025-05-27 16:52:00+00): Hello, MM! Many people find it hard to start or stick with a goal when they doubt themselves, or their ability. If this comes up for you, a simple way to bolster confidence is through affirmations. These are simple statements that recognize your personal strengths or effort. Like telling yourself, “I’m strong” or “My sense of humor will get me through.” 

If you’re not sure what your strengths are, think about a past hardship that you overcame. What helped you? (Look for strengths like dedication, hard work, creativity, or teamwork).

AGENT (2025-05-13 00:27:00+00): Hey there, Theresa. Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:
1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

AGENT (2025-05-16 16:21:00+00): Hello, Theresa. Great work digging into diet for dental health this National Smile Month. Here are even more calcium-rich foods for strengthening your teeth (and bones). There are non-dairy ideas, too: https://bitly.well.co/National-Smile-Month

AGENT (2025-05-20 23:47:00+00): Hello, Theresa! Good to hear from you! Ever wonder how to build better goals? One tip is to set “approach” goals. This means defining what you’ll do — rather than what you’ll avoid. For example, instead of saying “I won’t eat candy” an approach goal could be “I’ll try fruit when I crave sugar.” Approach goals are linked with more positive feelings, and can be easier to stick with.

AGENT (2025-05-21 14:19:00+00): Hello, Theresa! Thanks for chatting about water safety. Here are some tips to help keep you and your family safe: 

AGENT (2025-05-21 14:19:00+00): 1. Supervise children closely around water. And dress them in bright bathing suits, so they’ll stand out from the water.

2. Install a fence around all sides of home pools. It should be over 4 feet tall and have a lock that is out of children’s reach.

3. Enroll kids in swimming lessons, where they can learn water survival skills. 

4. Always have life jackets for all ages. You can’t rely on blow-up objects like rafts and pool toys as life preservers. 

5. Always swim with others. It’s especially safe when there’s a lifeguard present. 

6. Avoid mixing alcohol with water activities. 

Thanks again for chatting in today. We hope you have a fun and safe time in the water!

AGENT (2025-05-30 13:12:00+00): Hello, Theresa! Do you have a space in mind that you’re ready to organize? If not, pick one out, since today is all about decluttering. Here are 3 tips to get going:

Step 1: Make 3 sorting piles (or bins). Label these as “Need it,” “Maybe,” or “Don’t need.” Take your time going through items. Challenge yourself to consider what things you could donate, recycle, or give away. 

Step 2: After sorting all piles, aim to move half (or more) of the “Maybe” pile into the “Don’t need” pile. Then, make a plan of where (and when) you can give or get rid of these items.


Step 3: Clean up time! Reorganize with labels, boxes, etc. Enlist the support of someone you trust to make the job easier.

Remind you when to take them
Help you organize meds, or stay on top of refills

AGENT (2025-05-29 19:10:00+00): Nice to hear from you, MM. There are many forms of social support, and when it comes to meds, they can help in different ways. Experts have found that practical support is particularly helpful. This means things like having someone who can:

Remind you when to take them
Help you organize meds, or stay on top of refills

1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.

AGENT (2025-05-21 18:53:00+00): Hello, Joey! Thanks for reaching out to learn more about mini movement breaks. Taking 5 minutes to get up and move after 30 minutes of sitting can work wonders. 


AGENT (2025-05-21 18:53:00+00): Why it helps: Movement breaks can relieve muscle stiffness and discomfort from sitting too long. They can also sharpen your focus, fight fatigue, and boost your mood. Over time, they may also help lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol.

AGENT (2025-05-21 18:53:00+00): 
What counts: Any kind of movement! It can be lower intensity, too — like an easy walk, some quick crunches or pushups, or taking a few minutes to stretch and organize your space.


AGENT (2025-05-21 18:53:00+00): How to remember to take breaks: Set a timer on your phone or fitness tracker. Or buddy up with a friend who’d also like to try movement breaks. 


AGENT (2025-05-21 18:54:00+00): Always take care to follow your provider’s recommendations for exercise. We hope you found these tips helpful! Here are 30 points for exploring this topic today.

AGENT (2025-05-30 19:08:00+00): Hello, Joey! Many people find it hard to start or stick with a goal when they doubt themselves, or their ability. If this comes up for you, a simple way to bolster confidence is through affirmations. These are simple statements that recognize your personal strengths or effort. Like telling yourself, “I’m strong” or “My sense of humor will get me through.” 

If you’re not sure what your strengths are, think about a past hardship that you overcame. What helped you? (Look for strengths like dedication, hard work, creativity, or teamwork).

AGENT (2025-05-23 19:23:00+00): When stress comes from taking on too much, it is important to sometimes be able to say “no” and also think about what you can let go of to make your life a bit easier. Start by reviewing your list of priorities and daily responsibilities. Think about any areas where you may have taken on too much. Ask yourself if there are any responsibilities you can let go of – now or in the future.


AGENT (2025-05-23 19:23:00+00): If you have trouble saying “no” when others ask you to do things, consider practicing assertiveness. Assertiveness is an appropriate way to express your thoughts, feelings, needs and desires. Acting in an assertive way helps you to stand up for yourself, without being too passive or aggressive which can come across the wrong way. 


AGENT (2025-05-23 19:23:00+00): Here are a few tips to help with practicing assertiveness:

Try to keep your body posture relaxed and open. Make direct eye contact if you can. Keep a level tone of voice.

Use I- Statements to express how you feel, what you think or want. For example: “I’ve got a lot on my plate right now, so I’m sorry I won’t be able to take that on this week. Maybe another time.”

Try the Broken Record strategy of simply repeating your “no” answer.

AGENT (2025-05-23 19:23:00+00): If you have trouble saying “no” when others ask you to do things, consider practicing assertiveness. Assertiveness is an appropriate way to express your thoughts, feelings, needs and desires. Acting in an assertive way helps you to stand up for yourself, without being too passive or aggressive which can come across the wrong way. 


AGENT (2025-05-23 19:23:00+00): Here are a few tips to help with practicing assertiveness:

Try to keep your body posture relaxed and open. Make direct eye contact if you can. Keep a level tone of voice.

Use I- Statements to express how you feel, what you think or want. For example: “I’ve got a lot on my plate right now, so I’m sorry I won’t be able to take that on this week. Maybe another time.”

Try the Broken Record strategy of simply repeating your “no” answer.

AGENT (2025-05-27 20:29:00+00): Hello, MM! Many people find it hard to start or stick with a goal when they doubt themselves, or their ability. If this comes up for you, a simple way to bolster confidence is through affirmations. These are simple statements that recognize your personal strengths or effort. Like telling yourself, “I’m strong” or “My sense of humor will get me through.” 

If you’re not sure what your strengths are, think about a past hardship that you overcame. What helped you? (Look for strengths like dedication, hard work, creativity, or teamwork).

AGENT (2025-05-13 18:22:00+00): Hey there, Shannon. Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:

AGENT (2025-05-13 18:22:00+00): 1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
AGENT (2025-05-13 18:22:00+00): We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too.
So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

AGENT (2025-05-15 16:48:00+00): Hello, Shannon! Good to hear from you! Ever wonder how to build better goals? One tip is to set “approach” goals. This means defining what you’ll do — rather than what you’ll avoid. For example, instead of saying “I won’t eat candy” an approach goal could be “I’ll try fruit when I crave sugar.” Approach goals are linked with more positive feelings, and can be easier to stick with. So, what WILL you work on soon? Let us know!

AGENT (2025-05-21 12:11:00+00): Managing time and priorities under stress                          

Here are a few tips to work on managing your time better:
AGENT (2025-05-21 12:12:00+00): Write down how you spend a typical day.  Then, write down how an ideal day would go.  See if there is anything you can do to make your typical day just a little bit more like your ideal day. Start with 1 small thing.
Get better at setting priorities, and following through. Here are some steps:
AGENT (2025-05-21 12:12:00+00): Make a list of everything you are trying to do. Include household chores, and any work or caregiving responsibilities. 
Rank these in terms of what is most important. 
AGENT (2025-05-21 12:12:00+00): Think about what you can realistically do today, and what needs to be postponed. Look carefully at your list. Consider if there is anything that you could ask for help with… For example, can someone else clean or do the laundry? Is it worth paying someone to do some of the chores to refocus on other important things?
Finally, ask yourself- is there any ‘Me Time’ on this list? And if not, try to make 5-10 minutes for yourself to have a quick break. Use the break time to take a few deep breaths, or to step outside.

Yes I would be interested 
AGENT (2025-05-30 21:27:00+00): Thanks for chatting in with us today, Pamela. We see you’ve done SMART goals before, and look forward to working with you again. You can earn 50 points for setting a new goal with us today, and 100 points for weekly follow-ups.
We’ve adjusted this process recently, so that specific goals tie to a big picture “vision” of what you’d like to accomplish when it comes to health and wellness. So let’s start there today.
AGENT (2025-05-30 21:27:00+00): In a sentence (or two) can you please share what you’d like to achieve in the long-run with your health or wellness? We call this a “wellness vision.”

AGENT (2025-06-04 14:28:00+00): Hello, Pamela. We see you reached out inquiring on advice for crafting your SMART goal, while we are a health and wellness platform, we are not set up to provide diagnoses or direct advice. However we can suggest some examples such as, if your vision is to “eat healthy” a specific goal could be “swapping in brown rice (instead of white rice) at 2 meals this week.” When setting a goal what is most pressing to you right now in your life as far as an area that you would like to feel better about? 
CONSUMER (2025-06-04 14:39:00+00): Trying to eat 75-80 percent healthy 
CONSUMER (2025-06-04 14:42:00+00): Affirmation 
AGENT (2025-06-04 14:46:00+00): Ok Pamela.  So first, how will you benefit if you eat 75-80 percent healthier.  Would you like to change your diet, exercise more, practice mindfulness, or some other health behavior?

CONSUMER (2025-05-30 21:20:00+00): Hello 
Yes I would be interested 
AGENT (2025-05-30 21:27:00+00): Thanks for chatting in with us today, MM. We see you’ve done SMART goals before, and look forward to working with you again. You can earn 50 points for setting a new goal with us today, and 100 points for weekly follow-ups.
We’ve adjusted this process recently, so that specific goals tie to a big picture “vision” of what you’d like to accomplish when it comes to health and wellness. So let’s start there today.
AGENT (2025-05-30 21:27:00+00): In a sentence (or two) can you please share what you’d like to achieve in the long-run with your health or wellness? We call this a “wellness vision.”
CONSUMER (2025-05-31 20:08:00+00): I would like to establish and maintain a healthy weight . I am approximately 20 pounds over weight. I need help in losing and maintaining this.
AGENT (2025-06-02 10:40:00+00): You’ve defined your vision as establishing and keeping a healthy weight. Now, let’s think through the options for a first small step you feel ready to take at this time MM.

CONSUMER (2025-06-02 23:30:00+00): Okay thank you 
AGENT (2025-06-02 23:39:00+00): No problem! What's the first small step you feel ready to take at this time for your goal? 
AGENT (2025-06-03 14:40:00+00): Hello, MM. We just wanted to reach out and see if you were still interested in having us help you with forming a SMART goal? If so, your vision is to establish a healthy weight. What first step do you want to take to get you there?
CONSUMER (2025-06-03 16:05:00+00): Any advice will be appreciated 
AGENT (2025-06-03 16:10:00+00): Thanks for letting us know. So we can provide the best support can you tell us what type of advice would you like? Chat back and let us know.
AGENT (2025-06-04 14:28:00+00): Hello, MM. We see you reached out inquiring on advice for crafting your SMART goal, while we are a health and wellness platform, we are not set up to provide diagnoses or direct advice. However we can suggest some examples such as, if your vision is to “eat healthy” a specific goal could be “swapping in brown rice (instead of white rice) at 2 meals this week.” When setting a goal what is most pressing to you right now in your life as far as an area that you would like to feel better about? 
CONSUMER (2025-06-04 14:39:00+00): Trying to eat 75-80 percent healthy 
CONSUMER (2025-06-04 14:42:00+00): Affirmation 
AGENT (2025-06-04 14:46:00+00): Ok MM.  So first, how will you benefit if you eat 75-80 percent healthier.  Would you like to change your diet, exercise more, practice mindfulness, or some other health behavior?
AGENT (2025-06-04 14:47:00+00): Also, MM! Many people find it hard to start or stick with a goal when they doubt themselves, or their ability. If this comes up for you, a simple way to bolster confidence is through affirmations. These are simple statements that recognize your personal strengths or effort. Like telling yourself, “I’m strong” or “My sense of humor will get me through.” 


AGENT (2025-06-04 14:47:00+00): If you’re not sure what your strengths are, think about a past hardship that you overcame. What helped you? (Look for strengths like dedication, hard work, creativity, or teamwork).

AGENT (2025-05-13 20:38:00+00): Hello, Halima! Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:

AGENT (2025-05-13 20:38:00+00): 1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover.

AGENT (2025-05-28 19:23:00+00): Try writing down your concerns. What side effects are you most concerned about? Then write down the benefits of taking the med. How could it improve your health and wellbeing? 
AGENT (2025-05-28 19:23:00+00): Share your concerns with your doctor. They can inform you about any possible side effects and how to manage them. And if you do experience side effects, let your doctor know, in case they want to adjust your med.
AGENT (2025-05-28 19:23:00+00): If you’re worried about safety, remember that meds are approved by the FDA. That means they’ve gone through many tests and studies to make sure they are safe and effective. The FDA wouldn’t approve something if side effects were more than mild or dangerous to your health.
AGENT (2025-05-28 19:24:00+00): Think big picture. Reflect on why you’re taking a med in the first place — to improve your health. Thinking about the pros of your med can help put worries about side effects in perspective.

AGENT (2025-05-14 14:30:00+00): Good Morning, Kelly. Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:

AGENT (2025-05-14 14:30:00+00): 1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

AGENT (2025-05-23 11:34:00+00): Hello, Kelly! When you’re feeling nauseous, go for bland foods. Here are some ideas:

Keep it simple with plain crackers, toast, or white rice.
Reach for apples or bananas.
Try ginger candy, or brew up some ginger tea.
Grab a sweet treat with Jell-O or popsicles.
Avoid foods that are fried, high in fat, super sweet, or spicy. These can make nausea worse.

Nausea from GLP-1 meds usually gets better with time. If it doesn’t, reach out to your provider. Enjoy the rest of your day and the 100 points!

AGENT (2025-06-03 11:45:00+00): Good Morning, Kelly. Keeping a food diary can make you aware of what you’re eating and drinking… and how you feel after. Here are some tips to get started:


AGENT (2025-06-03 11:45:00+00): Choose your logging method — pen and paper or a digital device.
Establish a schedule: Track at each meal or at the end of the day. 
Include key details, like time of day, food/drink, portion sizes, and how you feel. 
Take some time to review it (on your own or with a provider). What patterns do you see? What’s working and what’s not? How might you adjust?


AGENT (2025-06-03 11:45:00+00): Check out this food diary template. It can be edited, printed, or used as a guide to create your own. Be sure to include how you feel after each time you eat or drink. Let us know if you have any questions and enjoy the 30 points!

Like telling yourself, “I’m strong” or “My sense of humor will get me through.”

CONSUMER (2025-05-31 00:55:00+00): I’m chatting in. “Facts on fats”
AGENT (2025-05-31 00:57:00+00): Hello, Randi! You can get a few different types of fat from your diet — saturated, trans, and unsaturated fats. And these fats affect your cholesterol differently. 

Saturated and trans fats raise your LDL or “bad” cholesterol — which increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. Meanwhile, choosing unsaturated fats helps lower your cholesterol and promote heart health. So, when choosing foods to eat, do your best to…

- Limit saturated and trans fats: Saturated fats are common in dairy products like butter and cream cheese and fatty cuts of meats like beef and pork. Trans fats are in fried foods and baked goods like pastries and pizza. These are best in moderation.
- Choose unsaturated fats instead: Fish (like salmon and trout), avocados, nuts, lean meats, and unsaturated oils (like olive, canola, and safflower oils) are all examples of unsaturated fats. These healthy fats can help you reach your cholesterol goals. 

Choosing healthy fats is just one of many strategies to help lower your cholesterol — in addition to getting plenty of exercise, managing stress, and taking meds if your doctor recommends it. Enjoy your 100 points!

AGENT (2025-05-15 23:18:00+00): Hello, MM! Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:
1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

CONSUMER (2025-05-31 00:55:00+00): I’m chatting in. “Facts on fats”
AGENT (2025-05-31 00:57:00+00): Hello, MM! You can get a few different types of fat from your diet — saturated, trans, and unsaturated fats. And these fats affect your cholesterol differently. 

Saturated and trans fats raise your LDL or “bad” cholesterol — which increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. Meanwhile, choosing unsaturated fats helps lower your cholesterol and promote heart health. So, when choosing foods to eat, do your best to…

- Limit saturated and trans fats: Saturated fats are common in dairy products like butter and cream cheese and fatty cuts of meats like beef and pork. Trans fats are in fried foods and baked goods like pastries and pizza. These are best in moderation.
- Choose unsaturated fats instead: Fish (like salmon and trout), avocados, nuts, lean meats, and unsaturated oils (like olive, canola, and safflower oils) are all examples of unsaturated fats. These healthy fats can help you reach your cholesterol goals. 

Choosing healthy fats is just one of many strategies to help lower your cholesterol — in addition to getting plenty of exercise, managing stress, and taking meds if your doctor recommends it. Enjoy your 100 points!

AGENT (2025-05-27 16:19:00+00): Try writing down your concerns. What side effects are you most concerned about? Then write down the benefits of taking the med. How could it improve your health and wellbeing? 

AGENT (2025-05-27 16:20:00+00): Share your concerns with your doctor. They can inform you about any possible side effects and how to manage them. And if you do experience side effects, let your doctor know, in case they want to adjust your med.

AGENT (2025-05-27 16:20:00+00): If you’re worried about safety, remember that meds are approved by the FDA. That means they’ve gone through many tests and studies to make sure they are safe and effective. The FDA wouldn’t approve something if side effects were more than mild or dangerous to your health.

AGENT (2025-05-27 16:20:00+00): Think big picture. Reflect on why you’re taking a med in the first place — to improve your health. Thinking about the pros of your med can help put worries about side effects in perspective.

CONSUMER (2025-06-04 15:20:00+00): Organize 
AGENT (2025-06-04 15:28:00+00): Good Morning, Alissa. We’re here with tips for organizing meds. Here are four different ways to keep track of your pills.

AGENT (2025-06-04 15:28:00+00): Get a pill box. These are special boxes with compartments for each of your meds. They come in all shapes and sizes. You can choose one with as many compartments as you need. And you can fill up your pill box on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. You can get these at the pharmacy or online.

AGENT (2025-06-04 15:28:00+00): Try an automatic pill dispenser. These are electronic devices that you (or a trusted friend or doctor) can program to automatically dispense your dose when you need it. They often have light or other signal to notify you when to take your meds, so you don’t miss a dose.

AGENT (2025-06-04 15:28:00+00): Use a color-coded system. This is helpful if you have meds for different times of day. Get a pack of colored labels to stick on your prescriptions. For example, assign green to your morning meds, blue to lunch-time meds and purple to nighttime meds. Then, you won't mix up when to take each pill.

AGENT (2025-06-04 15:28:00+00): Create a med checklist. Make a chart that lists each med, the dose, and what time you’ll take it. Then, check it off immediately after you take it. That way, you can refer back to the list if you’re not sure which meds you’ve taken yet.

AGENT (2025-05-20 17:37:00+00): Hey there, MM. Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:
1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

AGENT (2025-06-04 15:49:00+00): Nice to hear from you, Shameeka. There are many forms of social support, and when it comes to meds, they can help in different ways. Experts have found that practical support is particularly helpful. This means things like having someone who can:

Remind you when to take them
Help you organize meds, or stay on top of refills
Think about anyone in your life who already helps, or may be able to help with any of these tasks. Consider asking them for a hand. Or, if they’re on meds too, you can suggest to help each other.

Try writing down your concerns. What side effects are you most concerned about? Then write down the benefits of taking the med. How could it improve your health and wellbeing? 
Share your concerns with your doctor. They can inform you about any possible side effects and how to manage them. And if you do experience side effects, let your doctor know, in case they want to adjust your med.
If you’re worried about safety, remember that meds are approved by the FDA. That means they’ve gone through many tests and studies to make sure they are safe and effective. The FDA wouldn’t approve something if side effects were more than mild or dangerous to your health.
Think big picture. Reflect on why you’re taking a med in the first place — to improve your health. Thinking about the pros of your med can help put worries about side effects in perspective.

Chill out: Take a few deep breaths to calm those nerves.
Distract yourself: Binge-watch that show you've been saving, or crank up some tunes.
Numb it: Cool the spot for a moment beforehand.
Dry up: Let the alcohol dry completely before injecting.

AGENT (2025-06-04 17:59:00+00): Hello, MM! Here are 6 tips to make that med prick a lot less, well, prickly:
Chill out: Take a few deep breaths to calm those nerves.
Distract yourself: Binge-watch that show you've been saving, or crank up some tunes.
Numb it: Cool the spot for a moment beforehand.
Dry up: Let the alcohol dry completely before injecting. 
Cough: Believe it or not, coughing briefly actually helps lower pain.
Slow and steady: Take your time injecting.

We hope your next med injection is a bit less painful. Enjoy your 30 points!",,2025-05-27 13:29:41,1,744307,,Tips,,,

AGENT (2025-05-27 18:00:00+00): Hello, Shardia! Many people find it hard to start or stick with a goal when they doubt themselves, or their ability. If this comes up for you, a simple way to bolster confidence is through affirmations. These are simple statements that recognize your personal strengths or effort. Like telling yourself, “I’m strong” or “My sense of humor will get me through.” 

If you’re not sure what your strengths are, think about a past hardship that you overcame. What helped you? (Look for strengths like dedication, hard work, creativity, or teamwork).

AGENT (2025-05-28 18:32:00+00): Hello, Estefania! Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:
1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.

1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.

1. Supervise children closely around water. And dress them in bright bathing suits, so they’ll stand out from the water.

AGENT (2025-05-28 22:51:00+00): 2. Install a fence around all sides of home pools. It should be over 4 feet tall and have a lock that is out of children’s reach.

3. Enroll kids in swimming lessons, where they can learn water survival skills. 

AGENT (2025-05-28 22:52:00+00): 4. Always have life jackets for all ages. You can’t rely on blow-up objects like rafts and pool toys as life preservers. 

5. Always swim with others. It’s especially safe when there’s a lifeguard present.

Sit or walk outside, and notice the temperature and feeling of fresh air.
Gaze out a window for at least 5 minutes. See if you can spot 2 animals or birds, 5 different colors in nature, or 3 different shapes.

So let’s start there today. Also, you can earn 50 points for setting a new goal with us today, and 100 points for weekly follow-ups.

AGENT (2025-05-27 12:34:00+00): S = Specific. Focus on one clear change at a time.
AGENT (2025-05-27 12:34:00+00): M = Measurable. Consider how often or how long you want to work on it.
AGENT (2025-05-27 12:34:00+00): A = Action-oriented. Define something within your control. Focus on what you CAN do – not what you'll avoid.
AGENT (2025-05-27 12:34:00+00): R = Realistic. Goals should feel challenging, but doable. Consider what resources and support will make this goal reachable for you.
AGENT (2025-05-27 12:34:00+00): T = Time-bound. Goals should include a timeline of when you’ll start, finish, or check on progress.

Here are some tips on strength training- are you interested in further tips or  setting a goal around walking as well?


 Strengthening your muscles can improve your fitness and even make your bones stronger. Here are some tips to get the most out of it:
Aim for at least 2 days per week.
Work all the major muscle groups, including the legs, hip, back, chest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms.
Think outside the box. Sure, weightlifting works. But so do bodyweight exercises, gardening, and resistance bands.
Focus on keeping good form first and foremost.
As you get stronger, you can slowly increase the intensity by doing more reps or adding more weight.
Take time to recover between strength training sessions.
As always, check with your doctor before starting or changing your exercise routine.

Enjoy your 30 points. Here’s to being stronger than yesterday!

AGENT (2025-05-30 17:43:00+00): You can get a few different types of fat from your diet — saturated, trans, and unsaturated fats. And these fats affect your cholesterol differently. 

AGENT (2025-05-30 17:43:00+00): Saturated and trans fats raise your LDL or “bad” cholesterol — which increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. Meanwhile, choosing unsaturated fats helps lower your cholesterol and promote heart health. So, when choosing foods to eat, do your best to…

AGENT (2025-05-30 17:44:00+00): - Limit saturated and trans fats: Saturated fats are common in dairy products like butter and cream cheese and fatty cuts of meats like beef and pork. Trans fats are in fried foods and baked goods like pastries and pizza. These are best in moderation.
- Choose unsaturated fats instead: Fish (like salmon and trout), avocados, nuts, lean meats, and unsaturated oils (like olive, canola, and safflower oils) are all examples of unsaturated fats. These healthy fats can help you reach your cholesterol goals. 

AGENT (2025-05-30 17:44:00+00): Choosing healthy fats is just one of many strategies to help lower your cholesterol — in addition to getting plenty of exercise, managing stress, and taking meds if your doctor recommends it. Enjoy your 100 points! If you have questions. Please chat back in.

AGENT (2025-06-04 18:48:00+00): Hi Kevin. Thanks for chatting about water safety. Here are some tips to help keep you and your family safe: 
AGENT (2025-06-04 18:49:00+00): 1. Supervise children closely around water. And dress them in bright bathing suits, so they’ll stand out from the water.

2. Install a fence around all sides of home pools. It should be over 4 feet tall and have a lock that is out of children’s reach.
AGENT (2025-06-04 18:49:00+00): 3. Enroll kids in swimming lessons, where they can learn water survival skills. 

4. Always have life jackets for all ages. You can’t rely on blow-up objects like rafts and pool toys as life preservers. 

AGENT (2025-06-04 18:49:00+00): 5. Always swim with others. It’s especially safe when there’s a lifeguard present. 

6. Avoid mixing alcohol with water activities. 

AGENT (2025-06-04 18:49:00+00): Thanks again for chatting in today. We hope you have a fun and safe time in the water!

AGENT (2025-05-28 23:33:00+00): Hello, Lynn! Thanks for chatting with us about taking multiple medications. Here are some quick tips to simplify your medication routine.


AGENT (2025-05-28 23:33:00+00): 1. Group your medications together. Instead of taking them at different times throughout the day, take them at the same time each day.
2. If you take a med multiple times a day, ask your doctor if you can switch to a once-daily version of the med, instead. 
3. Some meds can be combined together. Ask your doctor if a combination pill of two or more meds you take is available for you. That way, you’ll have fewer pills to take.
4.  Reevaluate your medication list with your doctor. See if there are any meds you don’t need to take anymore. If you and your doctor agree on stopping a medication, you’ll have less meds to keep track of. 
5. Try using a pill box with a compartment for each med. That way, it’ll be easier for you to keep track of all your different meds in one place.
6. Set a reminder on your phone or watch to alert you when it’s time to take your med. That way, you’ll always remember to keep up with your routine.

AGENT (2025-06-03 20:38:00+00): Hey, Florence!! Thanks for chatting with us about statins, member. Here are some fast facts about statins, cholesterol, and your heart health.

AGENT (2025-06-03 20:38:00+00): 1. What are statins? Statins are a type of med that helps lower your cholesterol. 
2. What is cholesterol? It’s a fatty substance in your blood that your body naturally produces. You also get cholesterol from the foods you eat. 
3. Why work on lowering your cholesterol with statins? If you have high cholesterol, you have a greater chance of heart problems — like heart attack and stroke. Statins lower your cholesterol, which minimizes those risks. 
AGENT (2025-06-03 20:39:00+00): 4. How do statins work? Statins slow down the amount of cholesterol your body makes and get rid of extra cholesterol in your blood. This keeps your heart healthy and lowers your risk of heart attack and stroke.
5. Do you still need your statin if you don’t feel high cholesterol symptoms? Yes, if your doctor has recommended it. Most people can’t feel high cholesterol. Your statin med is still hard at work lowering your cholesterol, even if you don’t feel a noticeable difference.
AGENT (2025-06-03 20:39:00+00): 6. How do you know if your statin med is working? Your doctor can regularly check your cholesterol with a blood test. Together, you can monitor your levels as you continue to take your statin.

AGENT (2025-06-03 20:39:00+00): Hopefully, this helps you understand why your doctor recommends taking a statin. Let us know if you’d like more information on this topic. And enjoy your 30 points!

AGENT (2025-05-17 12:27:00+00): We do not have an update to share at this moment. We will let our internal team know you are looking for guidance. As soon as we have an update we will be in touch. 
AGENT (2025-05-20 22:07:00+00): Hello Santi, this is Danniel with the Technical Support team following up on your support case MTS-5866. This is in regards to the rewards discrepancy you have recently noticed in your Journey actions.

First, we'd like to thank you for reporting the issue and for your patience. We have identified the issue and are in the process of releasing an update. We expect have more information for you shortly.
CONSUMER (2025-05-28 16:39:00+00): Hello, do you have an update yet on when you’ll add the Missing points related to MTS-5866?
AGENT (2025-05-28 16:46:00+00): Hi Santi. It looks like our internal team is still working on this issue. We apologize for the delay. Once they have resolved the issue they are going to reach out and let you know. 
AGENT (2025-05-30 14:25:00+00): Hello Santi, we are reaching out about an issue with point allocation that you may have noticed within the Well App recently.


We want to provide our gratitude for your continued engagement. We have remedied the issue impacting your rewards totals for engaged content and you should begin to receive points for completing in-app actions once again. Please note that it may take some time for all activities to start earning points again. If this is not the case, and you continue to experience difficulties receiving rewards, please follow up with a Well Guide and we will provide additional support. 
 
The issue you experienced was caused due to a premature application of your annual incentive earnings maximum. Please note, that in the future as you approach this $400 earnings cap, you may once again begin to see points reduced.


The good news is that even as points are reduced, you will still be able to engage with Well and complete daily content such as Journeys, MyHealth, and engage with our Well Guides. 


Additionally you are still able to complete challenges to earn progress towards Alpha and Bravo.
As an added thanks for your continued engagement and patience while we addressed this topic, we’re also sending along 350 bonus points.

AGENT (2025-05-08 20:38:00+00): Hello, Laura! Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:
1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

AGENT (2025-05-15 19:42:00+00): Good Afternoon, Laura. According to experts, having a sense of purpose is linked with better physical health, and mental health. People with strong purpose report feeling happier in life, compared with those who don’t have a clear sense of purpose.

If you’re wondering how to find more purpose in life, here are some ideas…
1. Reflect on the parts of your life that are most meaningful. (Like mentoring, parenting, discovering something new, etc.) 
2. Write down how much time you spend on those activities in a week, or month.
3. Set a goal to increase the time you spend on 1 of those valued activities.
4. Get started! And mark your calendar in a month or so after you begin, to see if your sense of purpose is increasing. This process can take time.

AGENT (2025-06-01 18:43:00+00): Hello Deja, we are reaching out about an issue with point allocation that you may have noticed within the Well App recently.


We want to provide our gratitude for your continued engagement. We have remedied the issue impacting your rewards totals for engaged content and you should begin to receive points for completing in-app actions once again. Please note that it may take some time for all activities to start earning points again. If this is not the case, and you continue to experience difficulties receiving rewards, please follow up with a Well Guide and we will provide additional support. 
 
The issue you experienced was caused due to a premature application of your annual incentive earnings maximum. Please note, that in the future as you approach this $400 earnings cap, you may once again begin to see points reduced.


The good news is that even as points are reduced, you will still be able to engage with Well and complete daily content such as Journeys, MyHealth, and engage with our Well Guides. 


Additionally you are still able to complete challenges to earn progress towards Alpha and Bravo.
As an added thanks for your continued engagement and patience while we addressed this topic, we’re also sending along 350 bonus points.

AGENT (2025-05-12 19:23:00+00): Hey there, Perla. Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:

AGENT (2025-05-12 19:23:00+00): 1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.

AGENT (2025-05-12 19:23:00+00): We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

If you’re wondering how to find more purpose in life, here are some ideas…
1. Reflect on the parts of your life that are most meaningful. (Like mentoring, parenting, discovering something new, etc.) 
2. Write down how much time you spend on those activities in a week, or month.

- Take some deep breaths. Breathe in slowly. Pause, and breath out. Notice how it feels when you breathe, and pay attention to your out-breath.
- Enjoy a stroll. As you walk, notice your breath and the sights and sounds around you. As thoughts and worries enter your mind, note them but then return to the present.
- Practice mindful eating. Be aware of taste, textures and flavors in each bite, and listen to your body when you are hungry and full.
- Find mindfulness classes near you (or online). Examples include yoga and meditation classes. Sometimes there are adult education classes on mindfulness or stress in your community.""

Chill out: Take a few deep breaths to calm those nerves. Distract yourself: Binge-watch that show you've been saving, or crank up some tunes. Numb it: Cool the spot for a moment beforehand. Dry up: Let the alcohol dry completely before injecting. Cough: Believe it or not, coughing briefly actually helps lower pain. Slow and steady: Take your time injecting. 

We hope your next med injection is a bit less painful. Enjoy your 30 points!

AGENT (2025-05-29 12:34:00+00): Hi Ricardo! Glad to hear from you today. When it comes to daily stress, 2 factors matter a lot: a flexible perspective, and your resources. Here are a few steps to try:


AGENT (2025-05-29 12:34:00+00): Step 1: Take a moment to collect yourself. A few calm breaths are a great start.

AGENT (2025-05-29 12:34:00+00): Step 2: Reconsider the situation. Ask questions like, “Is this as bad as I first thought?” or “How can I make the best of this?”

AGENT (2025-05-29 12:34:00+00): Step 3: Think creatively about your resources (like time, or who can help). Decide if you’ll reach out to someone for a hand. Or, if you’re off-track on a timeline, let someone know. It can take some pressure off.

CONSUMER (2025-05-29 12:48:00+00): thank you 
AGENT (2025-05-29 12:51:00+00): Of course Ricardo, we're happy to help. In the interim if you need assistance with anything please feel free to reach out so we may assist. We hope you enjoy the rest of your day!",,,2025-05-12 20:19:52,1,#N/A,False Positive,N/A,,,

AGENT (2025-05-14 17:05:00+00): Hello, Dianna! Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:
1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

AGENT (2025-06-03 23:39:00+00): Professional care for depression
When it comes to your mood, many different types of healthcare professionals can help. 
For example, it may be good to start with a primary care doctor. Therapists and counselors can provide talk therapy. You can do that 1:1, in a group, or with family. There are also psychiatrists who can prescribe medications.

AGENT (2025-06-03 23:40:00+00): Professional care is important because the provider has training and judgement to recommend what level of care you may need. 
For example, in some mild cases, people with depression can manage well on their own.  In more moderate and severe cases, people may need medication or more intensive therapy.

AGENT (2025-06-03 23:40:00+00): Social connection, and a feeling of belonging, are basic human needs.
Studies show that connecting with other people can reduce feelings of depression and loneliness. It doesn’t have to be in person all the time. There are many ways to feel connected.  Here are a few ideas: 
1) Call or text someone you haven’t spoken to in a while.
2) Send someone a hand written letter in the mail
3) Set up a regular family video chat or family text group.
4) Send someone a weekly photo update or a message about something you did recently. 

AGENT (2025-06-03 23:41:00+00): 5) Look into joining a ‘virtual hobby’ group to connect with others who have similar interests.  (Like an online book clubs or music groups. 
6) Look into adult education classes.
7) Look into volunteer opportunities.
8) If you are religious, consider finding connection in spiritual groups.

It can also save you a long wait, since EDs prioritize emergency cases first. Instead, seek non-emergency care from one of these other options first:


AGENT (2025-06-04 15:15:00+00): - Contact your Primary Care Provider (PCP). Let them know that you’d like to schedule an urgent appointment.
- Go to an urgent care center. They can quickly treat common issues like sinus infections or sprains.
- Reach out to the 24/7 nurse line for help with health questions. You can call UNC Health Nurse Connect at 855-848-0424.
- Use your virtual care options. With Virtual Care Now, you can quickly see a UNC Health primary care provider — no appointment needed! To learn more, visit: virtualcarenow.unchealth.org

AGENT (2025-05-30 16:23:00+00): Good Afternoon, Tracie. Many people find it hard to start or stick with a goal when they doubt themselves, or their ability. If this comes up for you, a simple way to bolster confidence is through affirmations. These are simple statements that recognize your personal strengths or effort. Like telling yourself, “I’m strong” or “My sense of humor will get me through.” 

If you’re not sure what your strengths are, think about a past hardship that you overcame. What helped you? (Look for strengths like dedication, hard work, creativity, or teamwork).

We’ve sent over your 100 points. Have a great day!
AGENT (2025-05-30 16:23:00+00): Thanks for chatting today. Are you most interested in tips, setting a goal to manage anxiety, or finding a provider? 

CONSUMER (2025-06-04 17:09:00+00): know my options 
AGENT (2025-06-04 17:12:00+00): Hi, Tracie. Thanks for reaching out about care options! Avoiding the ED for non-emergency health issues can save hundreds of dollars. It can also save you a long wait, since EDs prioritize emergency cases first. Instead, seek non-emergency care from one of these other options first:

- Contact your Primary Care Provider (PCP). Let them know that you’d like to schedule an urgent appointment.
- Go to an urgent care center. They can quickly treat common issues like sinus infections or sprains.
- Reach out to the 24/7 nurse line for help with health questions. You can call UNC Health Nurse Connect at 855-848-0424.
- Use your virtual care options. With Virtual Care Now, you can quickly see a UNC Health primary care provider — no appointment needed! To learn more, visit: virtualcarenow.unchealth.org 

We hope this info helps if you ever need to weigh your care options. Here are 500 points for planning ahead!

AGENT (2025-05-15 17:19:00+00): Hey there, Anita. Thanks for chatting. Stress isn’t always bad – it’s how the body responds to a challenge. But chronic stress can take a toll. By navigating tough times, you’ll protect your physical and mental health. Here are 3 tips:

AGENT (2025-05-15 17:19:00+00): 1. Try “triage.” (They do it in the ER.) Prioritize tasks, and don’t try to do everything.
AGENT (2025-05-15 17:19:00+00): 2. Change the scenery. For example, if you’re stressed inside, look out a window, or step outdoors for a minute. Pause, breathe, and collect your thoughts.
AGENT (2025-05-15 17:19:00+00): 3. Talk it out. Share your perspective with a trusted friend, coworker, neighbor, or therapist.
AGENT (2025-05-15 17:20:00+00): We hope these tips help. And remember, getting enough sleep matters, too. So especially in high stress times, aim for those 7 to 8 hours so your body can recover. We’ve sent over your 30 points. Take care!

CONSUMER (2025-05-23 14:16:00+00): Approach
AGENT (2025-05-23 14:43:00+00): Hello, Anita! Good to hear from you! Ever wonder how to build better goals? One tip is to set “approach” goals. This means defining what you’ll do — rather than what you’ll avoid. For example, instead of saying “I won’t eat candy” an approach goal could be “I’ll try fruit when I crave sugar.” Approach goals are linked with more positive feelings, and can be easier to stick with. So, what WILL you work on soon? Let us know!

AGENT (2025-05-27 15:41:00+00): Hello, Anita! Do you have a space in mind that you’re ready to organize? If not, pick one out, since today is all about decluttering. Here are 3 tips to get going:


AGENT (2025-05-27 15:41:00+00): Step 1: Make 3 sorting piles (or bins). Label these as “Need it,” “Maybe,” or “Don’t need.” Take your time going through items. Challenge yourself to consider what things you could donate, recycle, or give away. 

AGENT (2025-05-27 15:41:00+00): 
Step 2: After sorting all piles, aim to move half (or more) of the “Maybe” pile into the “Don’t need” pile. Then, make a plan of where (and when) you can give or get rid of these items.



AGENT (2025-05-27 15:41:00+00): Step 3: Clean up time! Reorganize with labels, boxes, etc. Enlist the support of someone you trust to make the job easier.

Automatic monitors are easier to use, because you can check your pressure by simply pushing a button.

Some monitors can sync your data with an app on your phone and help you track your blood pressure over time.
